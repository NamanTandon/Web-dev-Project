      <h1><b>Hello World!</b></h1>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
      <p></p>
      <p>The C programming language is a general purpose programming language, which relates closely to the way machines work.</p>
      <p>Understanding how computer memory works is an important aspect of the C programming language. Although C can be considered </p>
      <p>as "hard to learn", C is in fact a very simple language, with very powerful capabilities.</p>
<p></p>
      <p>C is a very common language, and it is the language of many applications such as Windows, the Python interpreter, Git, and many </p>
      <p>many more.</p>
      <p> C is a compiled language - which means that in order to run it, the compiler (for example, GCC or Visual Studio) must take the code </p>
<p> that we wrote, process it, and then create an executable file. This file can then be executed, and will do what we intended for the </p>
<p>program to do.</p>
  <h3><b>Our First Program!</b></h3>
<p>Every C program uses libraries, which give the ability to execute necessary functions. For example, the most basic function called </p>
<p>printf, which prints to the screen, is defined in the stdio.h header file.</p>
<p>To add the ability to run the printf command to our program, we must add the following include directive to our first line of the code:</p>
<pre>
<code class="ccode">
  #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
</code>
</pre>
<p>The second part of the code is the actual code which we are going to write. The first code which will run will always reside in the main function.</p>
<!-- <p><code>int main()</code></p>
<p><b>{</b></p>
<p> <b> ... our code goes here</b></p>
<p><b>}</b></p> -->
<pre>
  <code class="ccode">
    int main(){<br>
      ....our code goes here;<br>
    }<br>
  </code>
</pre>
<p>The int keyword indicates that the function main will return an integer - a simple number. The number which will be returned by the </p>
<p>function indicates whether the program that we wrote worked correctly. If we want to say that our code was run successfully, we will </p>
<p>return the number 0. A number greater than 0 will mean that the program that we wrote failed.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, we will return 0 to indicate that our program was successful:</p>
<pre>
<code class="ccode">
  return 0;
</code>
</pre>
